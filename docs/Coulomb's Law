Coulomb’s law describes the electric force between two stationary electric charges. It tells us how strong the force is and whether the force is attractive or repulsive.
Statement of Coulomb’s Law
The force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
Mathematically, Coulomb’s law is written as:

Explanation of Each Term
F = k * (q1 * q2) / r^2
F :- This is the electric force between the two charges.
Its unit is newton (N).
q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the two electric charges.
The unit of charge is coulomb (C).

r is the distance between the two charges and its unit is meter (m).
where k = 1 / (4 * pi *ε_0 )
k = 9 × 10^9 N·m^2/C^2
ε_0 is the permittivity of free space, which tells us how electric fields behave in vacuum
and its value is 8.85 x 10^-12 C^2/(N.m^2)
Nature of the Force:-
If both charges have the same sign (both positive or both negative), the force is repulsive.
If the charges have opposite signs, the force is attractive.
This means:
Like charges repel each other
Unlike charges attract each other
Effect of Distance on Force
The force depends on the square of the distance between the charges.
If the distance between the charges is doubled, the force becomes one-fourth.
If the distance is halved, the force becomes four times stronger.
This shows that electric force decreases very quickly as distance increases.
Simple Example
If two charges are kept very close to each other, the electric force between them is strong.
As they are moved farther apart, the force becomes weaker.
Conclusion
Coulomb’s law helps us understand how electric charges interact. It explains that:-
The force increases with larger charges
The force decreases with increasing distance
The force can be attractive or repulsive depending on the type of charges
This law is the foundation of electrostatics and is widely used in physics and electrical engineering.
