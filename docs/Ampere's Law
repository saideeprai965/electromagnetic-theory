Ampere’s law relates the magnetic field around a closed path to the electric current passing through the surface bounded by that path. It tells us that electric current is a source of magnetic field, just like electric charge is a source of electric field.


∮ B · dl = mu_0 * I_enclosed
Meaning of each term
∮ B · dl
Line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop. It represents the total magnetic effect along the loop.
B:-Magnetic field at each point on the loop.
dl:-Small length element along the closed path.
mu_0:-Permeability of free space.
I_enclosed:-Total current passing through the surface enclosed by the loop.

Ampere’s law says that if you go around a closed loop and add up the magnetic field along the path, the result depends only on the current flowing through the loop. More current produces a stronger magnetic field. Currents outside the loop do not affect the result.
