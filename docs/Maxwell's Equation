Maxwell’s equations are a set of four fundamental laws that describe how electric and magnetic fields are produced and how they interact with charges and currents. Together, they explain almost all classical electromagnetic phenomena, including light.
1️) Gauss’s Law for Electricity


div E = rho / ε_0
Meaning
Electric charges create electric fields. The electric field spreads out from positive charges and goes into negative charges.
E → electric field
rho → charge density (charge per unit volume)
ε_0 → permittivity of free space

2️) Gauss’s Law for Magnetism


div B = 0
Meaning
There are no magnetic monopoles. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.
B → magnetic field

3️) Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction

curl E = - dB/dt
Meaning
A changing magnetic field produces an electric field. This is the principle behind generators and transformers.
curl E → circulating electric field
dB/dt → rate of change of magnetic field

4️) Ampere–Maxwell Law

curl B = mu_0 * J + mu_0 *ε_0 * dE/dt
Meaning
Magnetic fields are produced by:
1)Electric current
2)Changing electric field

J → current density
dE/dt → rate of change of electric field
